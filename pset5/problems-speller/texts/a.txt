Dear Students,

This is in regard to SMOKING IN COMMON AREAS of the Institute.

I believe you all know that as per Govt of India directives and as per
Institute rules it is a punishable offense. We, from the Student Affairs
through Welfare Board have been sensitizing students on the issue time to
time through posters, banners etc. Unfortunately, time and again we are
getting lots of complains from campus residents on smoking in common
areas.

Substance Abuse Prevention and Remediation Committee (SAPRC) has suggested
to fine all students heavily if found not following the guidelines. For
repeated ofvners even stricter action would be taken henceforth.

In the capacity of Chairman Students Welfare Board, it is my humble
request to you all to abide by the rules as I personally would be sad to
see any of you being fined and or any stricter action been taken against
your name.
Biman
Thank you for your kind cooperation in advance.
